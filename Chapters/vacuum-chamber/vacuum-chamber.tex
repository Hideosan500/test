In order to be able to fit the CRT screen, CF160 flanges were chosen for the test chamber. At one point during testing major changes were made, resulting in a differentiation by iteration.

\section{First iteration}
\label{sec:vacuum chamber first iteration}

A 3D render of the chamber is shown in  (\cref{fig:3D rendering of test chamber}).
 
\subsection{Parts}
\label{subsec:Parts}
 
The center piece consists of a 6-way cross with view ports at the front and bottom. A valve was installed at the back in order to flood the chamber with nitrogen\todo{pure nitrogen name?} when installing a new CRT to avoid oxygen poisoning. On the right side, a HiCube 300 Eco turbo pump was installed and on the left side a wobble stick was attached with a wire. A nipple fitting \todo{length} was installed at the top with a 5 port cluster flange, each being of type CF63.
 
In the middle port, a VSH vacuum transducer was installed to measure pressure. This needs a \SI{24}{\volt} dc power supply. On the left, a 19 pin connector \todo{how many pins and model name?} was installed to supply the necessary voltages to the CRT. Two flanges were equipped with four BNC feedthroughs each. One of them was used to connect do the x-, and y-plates, while the other connected to the wobble stick and aluminum foil at the CRT screen. Further explanation will be given in \todo{ref cd:Beam characterization, include picture there}. The last port was capped off by a blank flange.
 
For the inside wires, stranded copper cables were used. The chamber was sealed by rubber gaskets.

\subsection{CRT mounting mechanism}
\label{subsec:CRT mounting mechanism}

 Two M8 rods of length \todo{rod length?} were drilled into the cluster flange. On each, a L-piece was installed between two nuts and they were connected by an hose clamp. Two of these were used to secure the CRT inside the nipple facing the cross (\cref{fig:Image of CRT mounting mechanism}).

\subsection{Leak test}
\label{subsec:Leak test}

Before inserting a CRT, a leak test was performed. First, the chamber was set to a pressure of \SI{e-5}{\milli\bar} after which the pump was turned off. The pressure was measured once a minute for a duration \SI{3}{\hour}. The plot is shown in \cref{fig:Leak rate of test chamber after turning off pump}.
