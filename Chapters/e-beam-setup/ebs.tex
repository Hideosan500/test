\section{Charatarization of a working CRT}
\label{sec:Charatarization of a working CRT}

HAMEG HM507 oscilloscopes \autocite{HM507-manual} were used for testing purposes. These contain a D14-363GY/123\autocite{D14363GY123-manual} CRT hereinafter abbreviated as `D14', `tube', or `CRT'. Although the HM507 has only a bandwidth of \SIrange{0}{50}{\mega\hertz}, which is not sufficient for the hyperfine splitting frequency of \SI{461.7}{\mega\hertz}\todo{http://www.tobiastiecke.nl/archive/PotassiumProperties.pdf} of $^{39}\mathrm{K}$, it was used nevertheless because of its simple construction and availability. A schematic view of the device is shown in \cref{fig:electrode configuration} with the back pin arrangement in \cref{fig:pin arrangement}.

The voltages and currents of the necessary pins to drive the CRT were measured using a \SI{2.5}{\kilo\volt} probe \todo{model number} with an attenuation ratio of \todo{1:100 or 100:1} and are summarized in \cref{tab:D14-363GY/123 tube pin measurements}. It was not possible to measure pin g3 directly. Therefore a HVPS (\cref{sec:HVPS}) was used to set a voltage and the beam diameter was observed. The best focus was achieved with the voltage mentioned in the table\todo{current?}. The voltage offset of x-, and y-plates was not possible to measure directly, since it varies with time to draw the necessary image on the phosphor screen. The given values in \cref{tab:D14-363GY/123 tube pin measurements} are the mean of the minimum and maximum measured voltage. The deflection coefficient is summarized in \cref{tab:D14-363GY/123 deflection coefficient}.

\section{High Voltage Power Supply HVPS}
\label{sec:HVPS}

To produce high dc voltages to drive the CRT, four HCP 14-6500 power supplies\autocite{fug-hcp-manual} were used. They were named `HVPS 1' to `HVPS 4' and can provide up to \SI{\pm 6.5}{\kilo\volt} and \SI{2}{\milli\ampere}. To connect the output to the CRT pins, BNC cables were refitted with a save high voltage (SHV) connector on one side while on the other end the BNC connector was kept (\cref{fig:Coaxial cable with SHV and BNC connector}). A \SI{6}{\kilo\volt} probe\todo{find name of big yellow probe} was used to obtain the breakdown voltage, which is around \SI{3}{\kilo\volt}\todo{somewhere 2.5-4, find exact value} caused by the coaxial cable which was not built do sustain high voltages.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Ripple measurement}
\label{subsec:ripple measurement}
Each power supply was measured for its ripple with a set voltage of \SI{2}{\kilo\volt}. A \SI{2.5}{\kilo\volt} probe (attenuation ratio \todo{100:1 or 1:100})was connected to an oscilloscope set to ac coupling with a timescale of \SI{1}{\milli\second}. To get the electronic noise of the oscilloscope itself, the probe was shorted and the noise measured. A picture of a measurement is shown in \cref{fig:measurement HVPS ripple} with the values summarized in \cref{tab:measurement HVPS ripple}.

\section{CRT wiring}\label{sec:CRT wiring}
A schematic of the supplied power is shown in \cref{fig:schematics of wiring}. A small ac or dc voltage is necessary to drive the heater filament f. This part of the setup is explained in \cref{sec:Heater}.
