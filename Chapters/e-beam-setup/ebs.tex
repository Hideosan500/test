\section{Charatarization of a working CRT}\label{sec:Charatarization of a working CRT}

HAMEG HM507 oscilloscopes were used for testing purposes. These contain a D14-363GY/123\autocite{D14363GY123-manual} CRT hereinafter abbreviated as `D14', `tube', or `CRT'. Although the HM507 has only a bandwidth of \SIrange{0}{50}{\mega\hertz}, which is not sufficient for the hyperfine splitting frequency of \SI{461.7}{\mega\hertz}\todo{http://www.tobiastiecke.nl/archive/PotassiumProperties.pdf} of $^{39}\mathrm{K}$, it was used nevertheless because of its simple construction and availability. A schematic view of the device is shown in \cref{fig:electrode configuration} with the back pin arrangement in \cref{fig:pin arrangement}.

The voltages and currents of the necessary pins to drive the CRT were measured using a \SI{2.5}{\kilo\volt} probe \todo{model number} with an attenuation ratio of \todo{1:100 or 100:1} and are summarized in \cref{tab:D14-363GY/123 tube pin measurements}. It was not possible to measure pin g3 directly. Therefore a HVPS (\cref{sec:HVPS}) was used to set a voltage and the beam diameter was observed. The best focus was achieved with a voltage of \SI{-1.813e3}{\volt} \todo{current?}.

\section{High Voltage Power Supply HVPS}\label{sec:HVPS}

To produce high DC voltages to drive the CRT, 4 HCP 14-6500\autocite{fug-hcp-manual} power supplies were used. They were named `HVPS 1' to `HVPS 4' and can provide up to \SI{\pm 6.5}{\kilo\volt} DC and \SI{2}{\milli\ampere}. To connect the output to the CRT pins, BNC cables were refitted with a save high voltage (SHV) connector on one side while on the other end the BNC connector was kept. The output was measured with a \SI{6}{\kilo\volt} probe\todo{find exact value of big yellow probe} and the ripple was determined to be between \SIlist{116;204}{\milli\volt}. The breakdown voltages is around \SI{3}{\kilo\volt}\todo{somewhere 2-4, find exact value}. 

\section{CRT wiring}\label{sec:CRT wiring}
A schematic of the supplied power is shown in \cref{fig:schematics of wiring}. A small AC or DC voltage is necessary to drive the heater filament. This part of the setup is explained in \cref{sec:Heater}.
