\section{Charatarization of a working CRT}
\label{sec:Charatarization of a working CRT}

HAMEG HM507 oscilloscopes \autocite{HM507-manual} were used for testing purposes. These contain a D14-363GY/123 \autocite{D14363GY123-manual} CRT. This device only has a bandwidth of \SIrange{0}{50}{\mega\hertz}.It is uncertain wether this is sufficient to reach the hyperfine splitting frequency of \SI{461.7}{\mega\hertz} for $^{39}\mathrm{K}$ \cite{tiecke:potassium-properties} (or \SI{254}{\mega\hertz} for $^{41}\mathrm{K}$), it was used nevertheless because of its simple construction and availability. The back pin arrangement is shown in \cref{fig:pin arrangement}.

The voltages and currents of the pins to drive the CRT were measured using a \SI{2.5}{\kilo\volt} probe with a voltage divider of 100:1 and are summarized in \cref{tab:D14-363GY/123 tube pin measurements}. It was not possible to measure pin g3 directly. Therefore a HVPS (\cref{sec:HVPS}) was used to set a voltage and the beam diameter was observed on the phosphor screen. The best focus was achieved with the value written in the table. The voltage offset of x-, and y-plates was not possible to measure directly, since it varies with time to draw the necessary image on the phosphor screen. The given values are the mean of the minimum and maximum measured voltage. The deflection coefficient is summarized in \cref{tab:D14-363GY/123 deflection coefficient}.

\section{High Voltage Power Supply HVPS}
\label{sec:HVPS}

To produce high dc voltages to drive the CRT, four HCP 14-6500 power supplies \autocite{fug-hcp-manual} were used. They were named `HVPS 1' to `HVPS 4' and can provide up to \SI{2}{\milli\ampere} at \SI{\pm 6.5}{\kilo\volt}. To connect the output to the CRT pins, BNC cables were refitted with a save high voltage (SHV) connector on one side while on the other end the BNC connector was kept (\cref{fig:Coaxial cable with SHV and BNC connector}). A \SI{6}{\kilo\volt} probe was used to obtain the breakdown voltage, which was measured to be around \SI{3}{\kilo\volt}. The collapse was caused by the coaxial cable which was not built do sustain high voltages.

\subsection{Ripple measurement}
\label{subsec:ripple measurement}
For QUAK it is necessary to produce a stable electron source which in turn needs clean dc voltages. Therefore each power supply was measured for its ripple with a set voltage of \SI{2}{\kilo\volt}. A \SI{2.5}{\kilo\volt} probe (attenuation ratio 100:1) was connected to an oscilloscope set to ac coupling with a timescale of \SI{1}{\milli\second}. To get the electronic noise of the oscilloscope itself, the probe was shorted and the noise measured. A picture of a measurement is shown in \cref{fig:measurement HVPS ripple} with the values summarized in \cref{tab:measurement HVPS ripple}. As can be seen, the ripple of each power supply is very close to the noise of a shorted circuit and can not really be distinguished.

\section{CRT wiring}\label{sec:CRT wiring}
A schematic of the supplied power is shown in \cref{fig:schematics of wiring}. The pin i.c. stands for internally connected and is wired to pin g2, g4. A small ac or dc voltage is necessary to drive the heater filament f. This part of the setup is explained in \cref{sec:Heater}.

The heater provides an adjustable ac voltage, which is used to regulate the temperature of the cathode. In the cold state, the heater filament has an electrical resistance of approximately \SI{15}{\ohm}. When heated, its value rises to \SI{90}{\ohm}. The normal heater voltage for the D14-363GY/123 during  operation is \SIrange{6.0}{6.6}{\volt} according to \cite{D14363GY123-manual}. 
Our ac-power supply (shown in figure \ref{fig:heater_circuit}) consists of an isolation transformer (from grid voltage to 12 V). Its primary  and secondary circuits are isolated up to \SI{4}{\kilo\volt} \cite{DS44231-DataSheet}. The power supply has two  banana plug sockets to connect to the heater filament. 
It is connected to the transformer in series with a \SI{100}{\ohm} potentiometer. At full resistance, there is a voltage of approximately \SI{5.7}{\volt} applied to the heater filament, by lowering the resistance this value goes up to nearly the full voltage of the transformer. 
The current running through the filament is measured with an integrated ampere meter \cite{ACA-20PC-manual}, that measures currents up to  \SI{2}{\ampere} with \si{\milli\ampere} accuracy.

At the beginning of operation it is recommendable to set the maximum resistance and slowly increase the current to the desired value once the filament is heated up. As the resistance of the cold filament is significantly lower, high onset currents could otherwise damage it.
