\chapter{Short introduction to QUAK}
\label{ch:Short introduction to QuaK}

The goal of QUAK (quantum klystron) is to drive Rabi oscillations between hyperfine levels of the potassium atom using a classical electron beam. Suitable isotopes for this experiment are $^{39}\mathrm{K}$ which has a frequency of \SI{461.7}{\mega\hertz} or $^{41}\mathrm{K}$ with an even lower frequency of \SI{254}{\mega\hertz} \cite{tiecke:potassium-properties}. For this, it is necessary to \person{Doppler}-cool the atoms in a MOT. Once the atoms are trapped, they will be exposed to the near-field of the electron beam, which will be spatially modulated with the transition frequency. In order to achieve this goal, the beam must allow for a current of \SI{100}{\micro\ampere} and a beam waist of \SI{100}{\micro\meter}.

In our work, we conducted first experiments on how to accomplish an electron beam fulfilling those requirements.
