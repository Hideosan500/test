\section{Aluminum foil}
\label{sec:Aluminum foil}

In \cref{fig:Front view of vacuum chamber (first iteration)} the inside of the 6-way cross of the first iteration is shown. On one side of the phosphor screen, aluminum foil was attached to simulate the aquadag coating inside a CRT\todo{explain in basics what aquadag is?}. The beam was deflected on the aluminum foil and the BNC output was connected to ground through an ammeter to measure the beam current. As shown in \cref{fig:Difference in filament voltage and beam current between an open and sealed CRT} there is close to no difference in the filament voltage (and therefore heating power) between an opened and sealed CRT while the beam current on the aluminum foil varies widely. One possible reason could be that electrons scatter around and not all choose the wire path to ground. Therefore a Faraday cup (see \cref{sec:Faraday cup}) was used in the second iteration.

\section{Faraday cup}\todo[caption={error with figures}]{Package tikz Error: Sorry, the system call 'pdflatex -halt-on-error -interact}
\label{sec:Faraday cup}


In order to accurately measure the beam current, a Faraday cup was built. A schematic is shown in \cref{fig:Schematics of Faraday cup}. A copper tube was cut at an \ang{45} angle on one side and a Cu-sheet was soldered at the top and bottom. A small hole \todo{diameter?} was drilled at the top and a coaxial cable was attached on the mantle which connects to a BNC feedthrough at the top of the chamber. The small opening and bent floor were made in order to reduce backscattering as indicated by blue arrows. At the top surface a phosphor coating was applied in order to make the beam visible which made it easier to guide it into the opening hole.

With this improved setup, the beam current was measured again. A summary is shown in \cref{fig:Beam current dependence on heater current}. It can be seen that a current of over \SI{300}{\micro\ampere} was achieved, which is more than the necessary amount for the experiment. A problem is the fact, that the current is not stable. A measurement on the next day under the same settings resulted in a current between \SIrange{50}{120}{\micro\ampere}.
