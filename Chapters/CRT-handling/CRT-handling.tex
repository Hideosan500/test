tested helium content in drinking glass by having the bottom open for 30 s, 1 min, 3 min, 6 min, 10 min
lighter goes off when putting it in glass

tested the same with nitrogen with plastic wrap put on opening with rubber band and opening at the top for 3 min, 6 min, 10 min which also works with a lighter (flame goes off)

tested nitrogen with CRT Dev 3 for 6 min, 10 min which also works

tested CRT Dev 3 with helium leak tester
1st test with 1 foil, 1 rubber band
background: 8e-5 mbarl/s
CRT foil/opening next to probe: 2e-4 mbarl/s  to 4e-4 mbarl/s
next to open He gas cylinder: 2e-3 mbarl/s and up to 1.3e-2 mbarl/s

2nd test with 1 foil, 1 rubber band
background: 7e-5 mbarl/s
CRT foil/opening next to probe: 2.8e-4 mbarl/s to 4e-4 mbarl/s
CRT rubber/foil band next to probe: 4e-4 mbarl/s to 8e-4 mbarl/s

3rd test with 3 foils, 2 rubber bands
background: 2.2e-4 mbarl/s
CRT foil/opening next to probe: 2.9e-4 mbarl/s
CRT rubber band below foil: 7e-4 mbarl/s to 1.3e-3 mbarl/s

4th test with 1 aluminum foil hot glued to CRT
background: 6.6e-5 mbarl/s
on glued spot: 7e-5 mbarl/s to 7e-4 mbarl/s mostly under 1e-4 mbarl/s 
on foil itself: 7 mbarl/s to 8.5 mbarl/s
